# Changelog

Official releases of the plugins in this repository. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

The version lives in exactly one place: `plugins[].version` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` on `main`. The beta channel (`develop`) carries no version and tracks commits. This file is edited only on `release/*` branches.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-22

### Changed
- Repository renamed to `aspire-atlas/claude-plugin`; `repository` URLs updated in the manifest and docs.
- Release gate requires a version bump only when plugin content changes; docs and CI-only changes may land without one.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-22

First public release. Versioning restarts at 1.0.0; earlier 0.x builds were internal.

### Added
- `/aspire:aspire` skill: six-phase onboarding from connection check to first insights, brand context capture, and a Readouts section that sets up and schedules recurring reports.
- `atlas-account-analyst` agent: evaluates connected accounts and writes first insights back to Atlas.
- `atlas-creator-brief` agent: weekly content brief with deliverables, guardrails, creators sourced through Aspire discovery, priced engagements, and a published visual brief.
- `atlas-daily-readout` and `atlas-weekly-readout` agents: performance against baseline, anomalies, open action items, ranked next steps; Slack and email delivery; schedulable.
- Bundled Aspire Atlas connector (`https://atlas.aspire.io/mcp`, OAuth).
- Two release channels: `aspire-atlas` (official, pinned) and `aspire-atlas-beta` (tracks `develop`).
- Apache-2.0 license.
